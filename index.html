                Don't be intimidated by the name. In reality, I'm a friendly guy. I'll gladly guide you through all the amazing and scary things The Backrooms has to offer. You won't find a bigger expert; I've lived here my whole life and manage a large part of it as well. However, I insist that you strictly follow my instructions during your visit, otherwise I cannot guarantee your safety. I believe we'll enjoy the time spent together.
